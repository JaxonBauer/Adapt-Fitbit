## 1. Pull the Fitbit API connection code, and open it in your IDE of choice
> When you pull the code, you will have two examples of what the data should look like whenever you execute the file, both in HTML format. You should move these to a different file, and then execute the code again (after the connection is made in the next steps) in order to compare the files and make sure they are the same format.
